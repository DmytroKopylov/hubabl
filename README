Hubabl
------
Hubabl is a minimalistic real-time chat server. Every chat created has a bitly url.
Hubabl is written in node.js, uses socket.io for client/server communication and redis
lists and pubsub for chat history and chat events. It's ugly but usable : )

Installation
----------------
> install node.js
> install socket.io
> install redis

Setup
-----
> edit config.js to taste
> run ./redis-server in the redis package
> run node nodes/gen-dict.js //this will create a small dataset of random names for chatters
> run node nodes/server.js
